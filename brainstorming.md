 ðŸ§  Initial brainstorming ideas: 
The ideas are based on the available APIs so in the following the api name would be followed by decription of the app:
1. Wit.ai: Converts speech or text into recognizable actions
2. REST Countries: An API to provide information about countries like the language they speak, currency , etc.
3. Spoonacular Food API: An API to create recipe management, meal planning, and recipe analysis
4. Weather API: provides temp, ... for a specific location
5. Random Facts API: Retrieve random facts based on chosen categories


â€ƒðŸ§  Evaluation of top 3 ideas:
1. Wit.ai: Since the project would have very basic actions and not too many options this is not appealing for the purpose of this project
2. REST Countries: This API seems to provide good information about countries, it als contains the geo location and flag of the country that may make the app a bit challenging and make it desired. The API reply was checked through postman and its very readable and easy to work with.
3. Spoonacular Food API: the idea is very nice however, the api doesnt seem to provide information that is easy to work with and API docs are little complex to follow. also it seems its not free

   
 ðŸ§   Final app idea chosen:
For the purpose of this project, REST Countries is selected as it offers good information about a country and its easy to interact with.
